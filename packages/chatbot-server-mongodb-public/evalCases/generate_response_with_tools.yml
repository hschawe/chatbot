      About Atlas Data Federation
      Atlas Data Federation is a distributed query engine that allows you to natively query, transform, and move data across various sources inside & outside of MongoDB Atlas.

      Key Concepts
      Data Federation
      Data Federation is a strategy that separates compute from storage. When you use Data Federation, you associate data from multiple physical sources into a single virtual source of data for your applications. This enables you to query your data from a single endpoint without physically copying or moving it.

      Federated Database Instance
      A federated database instance is a deployment of Atlas Data Federation. Each federated database instance contains virtual databases and collections that map to data in your data stores.
